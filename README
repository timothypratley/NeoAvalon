== Minimal example of NeoAxis with AvalonDock

You need to download AvalonDock from http://avalondock.codeplex.com/ put the dlls in the NeoAvalon project directory.

Install NeoAxis from http://neoaxisgroup.com/

Copy Data and NativeDlls from C:\NeoAxis\NeoAxis Engine Non-Commercial SDK 0.91\Game\Bin to bin\Debug of the NeoAvalon project directory.

To generate the exception:
click on new view, then click on new browser.
The bug does not always appear but will occur often if you keep trying,
also you can get the same problem when docking.
